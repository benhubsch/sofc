# SOFC Event Request Portal

### Description

I am building an online platform through which student groups will be able to submit budget proposals and be notified of SOFCâ€™s final allocations. Upon submission, students will receive an automated email confirming receipt of their submission. After SOFC finalizes an allocation, students will again receive an email populated with information about their allocation. This project is being built with the long-term in mind, and I intend to construct it such that subsequent chairs do not have to be engineers to maintain it for their own purposes.

### Context

Historically, SOFC has handled everything through email. Budget submissions, questions, comments, and concerns have all been routed to sofcprogramming@duke.edu, which the Vice Chair of Programming is in charge of monitoring. That inbox is overwhelming and cluttered with emails of differing priorities. There are a handful of resulting consequences: emails are not always met with timely responses, and the disorganization leads to emails getting lost or mishandled. Understandably, that can lead to frustration on the part of student groups.

Furthermore, groups often send in budgets that are ill-formatted or do not contain all of the information that SOFC needs to complete allocations. For example, roughly ten percent of submissions fail to include a fund code along with their proposal, which is necessary to transfer the money into the correct account.

### Advantages

My proposal solves a number of the current pain points surrounding the programming allocation process. For starters, moving submissions online -- instead of through email -- cleans up the SOFC inbox substantially. That inbox would strictly be used for responding to questions or concerns. The single-purpose nature of sofcprogramming@duke.edu would make it easier for the Vice Chair of Programming to sort through priorities and respond to groups in a timely manner.

Furthermore, my platform would prevent a lot of busywork. It takes a couple of hours each week to tabulate programming allocations and get everything transferred, but it is a very mechanical process ripe for automating. There would be no mistakes from copy-pasting something wrong, misspelling an email address, etc.

Additionally, I would be able to implement data validation when users submitted programming requests online that ensured that requisite information was included with the request. For example, I could enforce inclusion of a fund code with the request by making that a non-optional form field.
